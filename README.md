# ZS-Data-Science-Challenge-2019
The challenge is a unique opportunity for you to put your coding and machine learning skills to test. You will get to solve a real-world data science problem and also get a sneak peek into the kind of problem statements being solved by ZSâ€™s Advanced Data Science team.

# NOTE
This is by no means a production ready code I only use jupyter notebooks for prototyping. The submissions were made in a 2 days "comptetive environment" where fast coding was as important as clean code.

PS: Secured Rank-336 amongst 10000+ participants with a MAE score of 0.876 on Public LeaderBoard.
